We want to be able to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform Fast, therefore the need for FFT.

a quote by Gilbert Strang:
"The FFT is the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime"

The Cooley-Tukey algorithm / FFT.

Signal processing
Data analysis
Medical imaging
Image and Video compression schemes.
MP3
H.264
Everytime you consume media on your device, an FFT is running in the background on your computer.
