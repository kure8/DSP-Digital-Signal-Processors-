Technical POV: 
1. How do we sample signals? (outside world into our computers)
2. Multidimensional Signal Processing ( 1D Signals vs 2D Signal processing (image processing) and above... Multi-Dimensional systems 3,4,5,6,7+ more degrees of freedom, movement, larger and larger datasets of measurements)

We have an ever growing importance of things like machine learning, deep learning.

These techniques put signal processing in a certain sort of identity crisis. We can sample and digitize a signal, thousands of samples a second, and we get a lot of this data and preprocess them within some circuits or algorithms to somehow replicate how our ears work and perceive. 

We go from lots of data in real-time, to just a few parameters to search by.

We have such enormous compute power, neural networks, and we have less need of the preprocessing... Or is this true?

We do not fully understand what the training is doing, or what the neural network is converting it too, it is on a path to revealing itself as yet another signal processing problem.

Jobs that are signal processing jobs, are not necessarily labeled as signal processing jobs. Basic knowledge in signal processing is necessary in almost any scientific career.
